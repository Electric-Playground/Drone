# Drone
Indoor Line Following Robot

The drone needs to adhere to the following specifications:
1. Safety: The drone must have shrouded propellers or be equipped with propeller guards.
2. Power: The drone must be powered by 1S or 2S batteries with capacity up to 800mAh, charged with commercially
available USB chargers only.
3. Travel distance: The drone needs to be able to travel at least 200 meters following predefined path (line defined on the
floor, with stop positions defined by a perpendicular line). Additionally, drone should be able to hover in place for a
specified time interval with drift no more than a few centimetres.
4. Altitude: The drone must be able to keep a stable altitude about 1.2 meters from the floor (adjustable on request by
user within range 0.5m to 2m)
5. Flight safety: Drones can be used only indoors following all safety procedures
6. Stabilization: Flight stabilization during hovering and following the line must be achieved using commercially available
sensors (e.g. gyroscope, accelerometer, barometer, ultrasonic sensors, image processing etc).
7. Communications: The team must implement system which allows the operator to take manual control of drone or
disable drone on request. As a safety precaution, drone should land or just switch off propellers if they lose
communication for 30 seconds.
8. This project has budget of $350 for prototyping activities.
